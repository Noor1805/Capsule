## 🔥 Features

### 🎥 Hero Marquee

- An infinite scrolling marquee that displays the text `Capsules®` across the screen using `gsap.to()` and `cloneNode()` for seamless repetition.

### 🪩 Scroll-Triggered Capsule Animations

- **Capsule 1**:  
  Expands to fill the screen as the user scrolls, then shrinks and fades.
  - Reveals `Terrace Capsules®` title letter by letter
  - Includes capsule description and a floating '+' icon

- **Capsule 2**:  
  Fades in from bottom, zooms into focus
  - Reveals `Classic Capsules®` with scroll-linked text animation

### 🔤 Text Animation

- Each letter in the capsule headings animates in with a fade + slide effect using `gsap.to()` and `stagger`.

### ⏳ Custom Loader (Optional)

> You can add a `Loader.jsx` using GSAP or basic CSS animation to create a preloading screen before showing the main UI.
